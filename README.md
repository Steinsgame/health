# Memorial General Hospital Analytics
## Overview
Memorial General Hospital (MGH) is a 500-bed regional medical center facing challenges with operational efficiency, resource allocation, and patient care quality. The hospital administration has identified that their current data infrastructure is fragmented, with information siloed across various departments (Emergency, Inpatient, Outpatient, Pharmacy, Billing, etc.). This fragmentation has led to:

+ Inefficient resource allocation (staff scheduling, bed management)
+ Suboptimal patient flow through the hospital
+ Increasing readmission rates
+ Rising operational costs
+ Difficulty in predicting patient volumes for staffing purposes
